This library abstracts js WebAudio API and falls back to <audio> HTML tag if WebAudio is not supported.
WebAudio may be not supported on some browasers that run player (need to check).
The most interesting thing is that this audio lib has the following description on its home page:
"buffer: Boolean (false by default) Set to true to force HTML5 Audio.
This should be used for large audio files so that you don't have to wait for the full
file to be downloaded and decoded before playing."

HTML5 audio tag supports 'autoplay' attribute that specifies that
audio will be played as soon as it can without complete download.
Also it has 'preload' attribute that serves as a hint for the browser
on how to download the audio. HTML5 audio tag is supported by almost all
the browsers:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement
It may provide useful events such as 'canplaythrough':
